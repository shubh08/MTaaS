# MTaaS
A platform for Testers, Project Managers to collaborate and test their project using Amazon Device Farm
The objective of this project is to venture into the new dimensions of providing the well-aware Mobile-Testing-as-a-Service(MTaaS) platform Amazon Device Farm as  Infrastructure-as-a-service(IaaS). This application becomes a bridge between the product owners/project managers and the testing personnels. The application will be hosted on the cloud and will support all the users ( tester/project managers/platform staff ) but each user will have certain access restrictions based on their roles.

The following are the 3 set of users that the application would support:

Freelanced Testers : A freelanced tester would need to sign-up on our application once before enrolling himself as a tester. The tester would have a TesterID and password that he would use for subsequent application accesses. The tester can add his details to his profile and even update it. A tester will have access to the the project bulletin where he can view the details of the projects that need testing done and join the same. He would also get notifications/alerts for various projects that he is a part of. Apart from these the tester can also request different types and numbers of devices for testing. He would also be able to run multiple tests parallely or sequentially on these devices and view all information regarding the same.

Test Project Managers :  A test project manager would need to sign up for the first time and sign in for all further access to the application. He too can add/update his personal details on the application. But majorly a manager would be able to create test projects and publish the same on the bulletin so that the testers can test the project. He would also be able to add/remove testers from his project. He would be able to view the billing details for using our application on his dashboard. Basically he would need to pay as he uses our application.

Platform System Staff : A system staff would be playing the role of an  admin in our application. He would have the hawk-eye view of all the projects that are currently live on our application and their billing details. He would have access to all the details of all the projects and thereby would be able to track and monitor their functioning.
